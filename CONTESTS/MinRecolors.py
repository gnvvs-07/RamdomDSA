# 2379. Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks
# You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the ith block. The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.

# You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive black blocks.

# In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black block.

# Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least one occurrence of k consecutive black blocks.

# Example 1:

# Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
# so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
# It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
# Therefore, we return 3.

# Example 2:

# Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
# Therefore, we return 0.


# Constraints:

# n == blocks.length
# 1 <= n <= 100
# blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B'.
# 1 <= k <= n
